The package is continually being developed as I turn lines of code that I frequently use into single functions. It currently includes the following functions:\r\n\r\n- `DropNA`: a function that drops rows from a data frame when they have missing (NA) values on a given variable(s).\r\n\r\n- `FillIn`: a function for filling in missing values of a variable from one data frame with the values from another variable.\r\n\r\n- `FindReplace`: a function to replace multiple patterns found in a character string column of a data frame.\r\n\r\n- `grepl.sub`: a function to subset a data frame if a specified pattern is found in a character string.\r\n\r\n- `MoveFront`: moves variables to the front of a data frame. This can be useful if you have a data frame with many variables and want to move a variable or variables to the front.\r\n\r\n- `PercChange`: calculates the percentage change from a specified lag, including within groups.\r\n\r\n- `shift`: a function for creating lag and lead variables, including for time-series cross-sectional data. The shifted variable is returned to a new vector. This function is largely based on TszKin Julian's `shift` function: <http://ctszkin.com/2012/03/11/generating-a-laglead-variables/>.\r\n\r\n- `slide`: a function for creating lag and lead variables, including for time-series cross-sectional data. The slid variable are added to the original data frame. This expands the capabilities of `shift`.\r\n\r\n- `rmExcept`: removes all objects from a workspace except those specified by the user.\r\n\r\n- `VarDrop`: drops one or more variables from a data frame.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nI will continue to add to the package as I build data sets and run across other pesky tasks I do repeatedly that would be simpler if they were a function.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n**DataCombine** is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). \r\n\r\nYou can also install the most recent stable version with `install_github` from the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"DataCombine\", \"christophergandrud\")\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
